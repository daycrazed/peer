p# peer is a project based solution for media production and distribution based on an Australian film and TV research 2012-2017.
Peer is about again rewarding owning content for its preservation and collectability. 
I am a Producer who has worked in Multi Media, Full feature and Broadcast TV production for over 10 years. I contributed to a research discussion about how to stop piracy in Australia by the head Foxtel Australia in 2012
After 4 years of deliberation I believe I may have a road map to reconnect audience with Distributors that adds growth and value to the Production of entertainment that has been hit by reduced value from digital distribution.

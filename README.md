# peer
A crypto solution for media production and distribution based on an Australian film and TV research from 2012-2017.
Peer is about again rewarding owning content for its preservation and collectability. 

I am a Producer who has worked in Multi Media, Full feature and Broadcast TV production for over 10 years. 

I personaly contributed to a research discussion about how to stop piracy in Australia led by the head Foxtel Australia in 2012
After 4 years of deliberation I believe I may have a road map to reconnect audience with distributors that adds growth and value to the production of entertainment that has been hit by loss of the value of ownership.
